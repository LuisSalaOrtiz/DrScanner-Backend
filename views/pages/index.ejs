    <h1>DrScanner Server</h1>
    <p>Introduction

DrScanner is an application to manage patient’s medical files in a more efficient, organized way, while implementing a fast and simple process. All of the patient’s file will be assigned an unique QR Code. When the QR code is scanned, the application will look, inside a SQL server, for the patient’s file associated with said QR code. If the file does not exist, then new information could be entered to be assigned to the scanned QR Code. If it exists, then the user will have the option to look at the patient’s information and edit it. This app is meant to make the patient registration and the retrieval of the patient’s files easier for hospitals and medical offices in general. Since the world has become more “mobile” in the recent years with the boom of smartphones and tablets, it is fitting that DrScanner should be a mobile application, because of the simplicity these provide. The platform to be used for the creation of the application will be Android. Android is an open source operating system that is distributed on a variety of mobile systems which are accessible and affordable, making the implementation a breeze compared to other conventional technologies. Also, the fact that android runs on most of smartphones today would assure the product a bigger reach.</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How this sample app works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This app was deployed to Heroku, either using Git or by using <a href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started">Heroku Button</a> on the repository.</li>

        <li>When Heroku received the source code, it fetched all the dependencies in the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a>, creating a deployable slug.</li>
        <li>The platform then spins up a dyno, a lightweight container that provides an isolated environment in which the slug can be mounted and executed.</li>
        <li>You can scale your app, manage it, and deploy over <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/">150 add-on services</a>, from the Dashboard or CLI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the Heroku Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app</li>
          <li><code>cd node-js-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name></code> - associate the Heroku app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to Heroku</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
